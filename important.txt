1. open gitbash ..
2. change directory to cd /c/Kaushik/study/python/flask_test/flask_plurasite/PythonFlask-JobBoard
3. source C:/kaushik/study/virtual_env/pyvnv371/Scripts/activate

6. Previewing Your Work
   You can preview your work by running flask run in the root of your fork. Then visit http://localhost:5000 in your browser. 
   You will see a working preview after completing the first module. 
   Note: On Windows you may need to run python -m flask run instead of flask run.

7. First under jobs folder create a file name app.py , import Flask and render_template
8. Now we need to have a folder to start all of the templates for the application 
   i. so under jobs folder create a folder named templates
   ii. create a file named index.html under that templates directory

9. so we made all the necessary changes for the module1 , we can test it with the following 
   pytest -k module1
9. Once module 1 is completed push your code to git 
    git add . && git commit -m "Completed module"
    git push origin master

10. Now we will have to implement module2, we can start with the following command to know what are missing
    pytest -k module2

11. gitignore important.txt file
